# Tripwire Directory Integrity Script in Linux (Fedora)

This project implements a simple, Python-based directory integrity checker ("tripwire"), which records or audits the hash states of files in a monitored directory.

## üö© Project Scenario

You are tasked with building a "tripwire" script to detect added, changed, or removed files by comparing a directory's state against a pre-existing record.

## üìù Features

- Create a static record of all files in a directory with their hash values.
- Later, audit the directory for changes (modifications, additions, deletions).
- Console reporting for real-time monitoring.
- Error handling for arguments and file operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
- To create a reference record for a directory (in my case, the script runs as 'python3 tripwire.py <directory_to_monitor> <tripwire_record_file> c')
  - The script will evaluate a directory and calculate an MD5 hash value for each file in the directory. I created test files to demonstrate as an example.
  - The 'c' flag simply indicates to create the tripwire record file. 
  - Next, the script will create a tripwire record file to store the file name and hash values. 
- Integrity check for changes (added/removed/modified) in the directory:
  - 'python3 tripwire.py <tripwire_record_file>'
  - This script will evaluate the tripwire record file for any changes to the directory and modifications to files.

## üí° Key Concepts Demonstrated

- File I/O and directory traversal in Python.
- Cryptographic hash (MD5 or SHA family) for file integrity.
- Command-line argument parsing.
- Data structures for tracking added, removed, modified files.
- Error handling for real-world scripting.

## üìù Pseudocode & Function Overview
Block comment at the top of `tripwire.py` should provide high-level pseudocode for clarity.

## Screenshots:
- Here is my file structure in my home directory, with my tripwire Python file and tripwireDir directory created.

- Create a sample file in the directory. We will also create a second file to demonstrate a removed file was evaluted in the "compare" script

- The "compare" script will evaluate the tripwireRecord file with the directory to assess any files that have been added, removed, or modified.

I hope this helps you understand how a tripwire code can be greatly beneficial in ensuring file integrity for your systems!
